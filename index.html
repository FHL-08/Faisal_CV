                        <li>The teams were tasked with developing an algorithm that simulates the aggregation action of naturally occurring swarms with either the MONA or the Pi-Puck robot modules</li>
                        <li>Developed a Switch-Case conditional statement-based algorithm, implementing a feedback loop using Arduino, inspired by the behaviour of bees</li>
                        <li>Combined the feedback loop code with the infra-red detection algorithm developed by teammates and thus finalising the aggregation algorithm</li>
                        <li>Presented the Queen-Worker Bee Algorithm to the judges, discussing the principle of the interaction between the robots</li>

                        <li>Implemented feedback control methodologies to detect and adjust the path of the Arduino as the buggy navigates the maze, eliminating collision events by over 90%</li>
                        <li>Employed Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in the control of the motors, allowing for a smooth continuous motion around sharp corners, further reducing the completion time by 10%</li>
